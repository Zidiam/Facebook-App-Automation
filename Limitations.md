# Limitations
There are a few limitations for Android while IOS has many limitations when it comes to automating Facebook's app

You need at least around 100gb of free storage to download all the software and to fully automate Facebook's app.

# IOS
Can only automate on a MAC while window users need to install VirtualBox to setup a MACOS on their computers.

When using the simulator there is no way to install Facebook, thus not able to automate the Facebook app.

When using a real phone you can only be able to automate the Facebook app is if you have Appleâ€™s Developer Program Team ID which will allow you to simulate your phone onto the mac pc. 

To bypass not being able to automate Facebook's app you can go through Safari app and go onto Facebook's website and automate Facebook's features through there.

# Anroid
Running multiple login tests causes Facebook to lock their app from singing in. To go around this issue you can just restart the phone.
